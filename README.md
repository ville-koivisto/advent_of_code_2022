# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my personal effort for the 2022 coding advent calendar puzzles. These solutions propably are far from the optimal, it's just me playing around with Go, trying things out and having fun.

What you will find from here includes at least:
* weird solutions and wacky implementations
* antipatterns of all sort
* nonidiomatic Golang in its purest form
* me writing to myself
